# git add 

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you wnat to keep, you'll need to ude the 'get add' comand.

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you can get away with the command 'git add.' which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using 'git add file1 file2' which will track specifically file1 and file2

You can speficy tracking directories with 'git add DirectoryName'.
